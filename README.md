# Starsystem

Playing around with Elm and live code updates by building a game.

The rough idea is to build a spaceship game where you can move around within a star system.

When/if there is ever enough game there I hope to add multiplayer through the phoenix server.

**Status:** Basic hot-code-reload setup done. Some basics in place.

# Dev

    mix deps.get

    cd web/elm
    source paths.env
    elm package install -y
    cd ../..

    mix phoenix.server

Then visit <http://localhost:4000>, edit [web/elm/Game.elm](/web/elm/Game.elm) and see the changes.

If you play the game (currently not much of a game, but A and D will rotate the ship),
you can edit the code and see the changes applied without the game resetting.
